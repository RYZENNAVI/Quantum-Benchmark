The original dataset consists of 8×8 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), with approximately 180 samples per class and a total of 1797 images.\nIn this subset, only the digits 0 and 1 are selected, resulting in a smaller binary classification dataset. Each selected image is resized to 3×3 pixels using reflective interpolation and then flattened to a 9-dimensional vector with normalized pixel values.\n```\n0  =  Label 0\n1  =  Label 1\n```"
