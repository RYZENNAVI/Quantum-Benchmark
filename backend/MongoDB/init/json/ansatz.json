      "description":"The CVNeuralNetLayers Ansatz is used for continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems. It is made up of layers that include local operations like displacement, squeezing, and rotation, as well as interferometers that create entanglement between modes. The BS (beamsplitter) blocks in the circuit perform this entanglement by mixing adjacent quantum modes. Each layer works like a classical neural network and allows complex transformations of quantum states on photonic hardware. This Ansatz is especially useful for tasks that need flexible, nonlinear transformations of continuous-variable data, such as in quantum machine learning."

      "description":"The StronglyEntanglingLayers Ansatz creates alternating layers of single-qubit rotations and two-qubit entangling gates. Each layer includes parameterized rotations (typically RX, RY, RZ) applied to every qubit, followed by controlled-Z or CNOT entangling gates arranged in a fixed pattern.\nThis Ansatz is widely used in variational quantum algorithms because it introduces a strong level of entanglement and expressivity, which makes it suitable for learning complex functions. The layer structure is regular and scalable, making it practical for circuits of various sizes."
