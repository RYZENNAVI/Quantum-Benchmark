      "description":"Basis embedding associates each input with a computational basis state of a qubit system. Therefore, classical data has to be in the form of binary strings. \nThe embedded quantum state is the bit-wise translation of a binary string to the corresponding states of the quantum subsystems. For example, x=1001 is represented by the 4-qubit quantum state |1001⟩. Hence, one bit of classical information is represented by one quantum subsystem."
