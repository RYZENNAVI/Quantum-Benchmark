# Quantum Circuit JSON Validation Rules

**Version**: 3.1
**Filename**: `quantum_circuit_validation_rules.md`

---

## 1. Top-Level Structure Requirements

The JSON input must be an object with the following fields:

- **`circuit`**
  - Required.
  - Must be a list of gate objects.
  - Must contain at least one gate.

- **`parameters`**
  - Required.
  - Must be a list of strings.
  - Each string represents a symbolic parameter that may be used in gate definitions.

- **`inputs`**
  - Required.
  - Must be a list of strings.
  - Each string represents an input name (e.g., user-defined variable names).

- **`qubits`**
  - Optional.
  - Must be a positive integer.
  - Represents the total number of qubits used in the circuit.
  - If omitted, it will be inferred as `max(target âˆª control) + 1` (i.e., `wires + 1`).
  - The final `qubits` value (provided or inferred) **must equal** the number of entries in `inputs`.

---

## 2. Gate Entry Requirements

Each item in the `circuit` list must be a dictionary describing a quantum gate
and must include the following fields:

- **`type`**
  - Required.
  - A string specifying the gate type.
  - Must be one of:
    - `H`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `RX`, `RY`, `RZ`, `CNOT`, `CZ`, `SWAP`, `MEASURE`

- **`target`**
  - Required.
  - A non-empty list of integers.
  - Each integer represents a non-negative qubit index.

The order of gates in the list implicitly defines their execution order.

---

## 3. Control Qubit Validation

- The optional **`control`** field is only allowed for the following gate types:
  - `CNOT`, `CZ`

- Rules:
  - Must be a list of integers (qubit indices).
  - Control qubits must be non-negative.
  - The list of control qubits must not overlap with the target qubits of the same gate.

---

## 4. Parameter Validation

- Only the following gate types may include a **`params`** field:
  - `RX`, `RY`, `RZ`

- Rules for `params`:
  - Must be a non-empty list.
  - Each element must be **one** of the following:
    - A numeric value within the range `[-6.2832, 6.2832]`.
    - A string that appears in the top-level `parameters` list.
    - A string that appears in the top-level `inputs` list.

- For all other gate types:
  - The `params` field must be omitted or empty.

---

## 5. Special Rules for the `MEASURE` Gate

- The gate type `MEASURE` is used to represent measurement of qubits.
- It must be the **last** gate in the `circuit` list.
- Measurement gates follow the same format as other gates but usually do not have `params` or `control` fields.

---

## 6. Error Handling

Validation will fail and descriptive error messages will be returned if:

- The input is not a valid JSON file.
- Required fields are missing or have incorrect types.
- Invalid gate types or parameters are used.
- Illegal control/target configurations are found.
